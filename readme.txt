Disable Wordpress's native Gutenberg or TinyMCE editor in favor of a Markdown editor.

== Description ==

This plugin replaces the Gutenberg block editor (or the classic TinyMCE) on the edit screen with [EasyMDE](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor), a markdown editor based on CodeMirror.

The content is saved with the markdown syntax in the database and is rendered on the frontend via wordpress native filters thanks to the [Parsedown](https://parsedown.org) PHP library.

- v3.6: Performance improvements with spellchecker and suggestions
- v3.5: Adding support for right-to-left alphabets like Arabic, Hebrew, or Persian
- v3.4: Adding support for categories, tags and taxonomies description field (Woocommerce and REST API compatible)
- v3.3: Support for multiple html attributes, compatibility with acf_form added for the frontend, basic compatibility with block styles
- v3.2: Support to enable markdown only for custom fields
- v3.1: Side preview panel fixed
- v3.0: Choose and sort the default toolbar buttons
- v2.6: Sticky toolbar with the editor
- v2.6: Possible to disable OP Cache
- v2.5: Video playlist support added

- v1.4: Extra markdown syntax added
- v1.3: Static cache files with OP Cache enabled by default
- v1.2: Autoconvert Youtube & Vimeo links to iframes
- v1.1: Support with lightbox and masonry for the gallery layout

That's pretty all you should know. It's under active development, keep in touch and feel free [to drop a line on the forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/markup-markdown/), [to let a rating](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/markup-markdown/reviews/) or even support me by buying a coffee !

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to install =

The same as usual:

1. Just download and upload the zip file to your wordpress instance. Or install directly by simply searching from the WP plugin panel.
2. Activate the extension.

All done! That's all you should do.

= Is it still compatible with Gutenberg or any other builder?

**Yes but you can't use both at the same time ;-)**
Data are saved as pure markdown code in the database, for the other builders on the market data are saved as HTML or custom markups like shortcodes. Currently data are still saved but won't be converted or rendered correctly if you revert back or switch between editors.

= Can I switch between editors or allow the markdown editor for specific users ? =

**Yes, please keep in mind it's a global switch for every user. You need to stick to one editor with one post type.**
Any block editor will be disabled for **all the users** of your Wordpress instance. _filters_ are available to disable the markdown editor for specific custom post types at a global level. For example you can do a setup to use _Divi_ or _Elementor_ to edit your pages and _Markdown_ to edit your blog'posts. Please refer to the forum to know how to do it.

= Can I use it with custom fields? (Or within my theme) =

Sure, developers & designers can access the public properties & methods of the instance inside their templates through the global _mmd_ function. For example let's say you want to use it with a custom field called 'foo_bar'. You can use something
like that:

`<?php echo mmd()->markdown2html( get_post_meta( get_the_ID(), 'foo_bar' , true ) ); ?>`

Disclaimer: with the plugin Advanced Custom Field (ACF), HTML content has been sanitized since v6.2.5.
If you need to render iframes or others elements, instead of using:

`<?php the_field( 'my_custom_field' ); ?>`

 use

`<?php echo mmd()->markdown2html( get_field( 'my_custom_field' ) ); ?>`

= What's the deal with the beta interface? =

The default editor is based on EasyMDE so you can write in markdown and use Wordpress feature at the same time. The side panel preview mode has been fixed since 3.0.
The beta interface is based on SummerNote, a jQuery WYSIWYG Engine. _The beta interface has been removed since 3.0 and will be available as a separate addon._ It's a custom version so you can get a live rendering when typing your content or adding medias. It's not perfect, it's still working well but for now you will have to modify the code on your own (builder or database) if something goes wrong. To find out more check my article here: https://www.markup-markdown.com/blog/wordpress-plugins/dynamic-input-method-markdown/

= Accessibility =

The current version is based on components that are not compatible with assistive devices like screen readers. Several available alternative plugins could cover the gap while I'm working on a new interface. Thank you for your patience and your understanding.
